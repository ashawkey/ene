/*
 * Search-term highlighting, and scrolling to the match rather than to the page.
 *
 * A result link carries `?q=<query>` and the section anchor Pagefind found. The anchor gets
 * the browser to roughly the right place on its own; this module then finds the actual words
 * in the document and takes the reader to the line they matched.
 *
 * Highlighting uses the CSS Custom Highlight API — ranges registered with the browser and
 * painted by a `::highlight()` rule — rather than wrapping matches in <mark>. That is not a
 * stylistic preference. Wrapping would insert elements inside `#write`: `kiwi.css` uses
 * `#write > *:first-child`, and a <mark>
 * injected mid-paragraph would also break KaTeX's markup and split text nodes the theme's
 * selectors expect intact. Ranges leave the DOM untouched.
 *
 * Where the API is missing the highlight is simply skipped; the scroll still happens, which
 * is the more useful half.

 * words back would highlight nothing on the page you were just sent to. Matching on a prefix
 * of each word is the cheap approximation that keeps the highlight and the result in
 * agreement, and it is why terms shorter than two characters are dropped rather than
 * highlighting a letter everywhere it appears.
 *
 * The stripping has to be Unicode-aware: `\W` is ASCII-only, so `^\W+|\W+$` eats every
 * character of a CJK query — to an ASCII \W, a Han ideograph is a non-word — and leaves
 * nothing to highlight. Stripping only what is neither letter nor number keeps 二叉树
 * intact and also trims CJK quotes like 「」 that the splitter never sees. And because a
 * single Han character is a real word in Chinese — unlike a stray Latin letter — it
 * survives the length filter.

 * Syntax highlighting for fenced code, in CodeMirror's vocabulary.
 *
 * Typora highlights fences with CodeMirror 5, so themes colour code through
 * `.cm-s-inner .cm-keyword` and friends. Emitting Prism's own `token keyword`
 * names instead would leave every one of those selectors resolving but matching nothing, and
 * code would render in a single flat colour: a failure the DOM assertions cannot see,
 * because the classes are all present and correct.
 *
 * So we tokenise with Prism and relabel through ./token-map.ts. Highlighting runs once per
 * fence at build time, which is why there is no cache here and no incremental path — both
 * only earn their keep when the same block is re-highlighted on every keystroke.

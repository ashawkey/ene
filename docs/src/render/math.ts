 * Formulas, rendered once at build time.
 *
 * An editor has to load KaTeX lazily, because it cannot know whether the document being
 * typed will ever contain a formula. A generator knows exactly, and knows it before the
 * reader does — so the maths is rendered here and the browser is never asked to load KaTeX
 * at all. Only katex.min.css and the glyph fonts ship, and a page with no formula pulls
 * neither.
 *
 * `.md-inline-math` and `.md-math-block` are the containers the stylesheets use to position
 * maths. They are emitted even though we render with KaTeX rather
 * than Typora's MathJax: what is lost is glyph-level `.MathJax` styling, while placement —
 * which is what the container classes control — still works.
